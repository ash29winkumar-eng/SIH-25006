## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying

## Theme
Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a Digital Farm Management Portal designed specifically for Pig and Poultry farms to promote and monitor biosecurity practices effectively.

This user-friendly web and mobile application will act as a one-stop solution for farmers, veterinarians, and officials to manage farm health and prevent disease outbreaks.

The portal will include the following key components:

## Risk Assessment Tool:

A questionnaire-based self-assessment module for farmers to evaluate biosecurity status.

AI-driven recommendations for improving farm hygiene, waste management, and movement control.

## Interactive Training and Awareness Modules:

Videos, infographics, and multilingual content explaining best practices.

Online quizzes and certificates for farmers completing training modules.

## Compliance and Record Tracking:

Digital logbook for vaccination, feed, and health records.

Automated compliance reports aligned with national biosecurity norms.

## Real-Time Alerts and Monitoring:

Notification system for nearby disease outbreaks using GPS and government data.

Early warning alerts for suspected biosecurity breaches.

## Networking and Support System:

Forum for communication between farmers, veterinary officers, and extension workers.

Access to government schemes, subsidy details, and helplines.

Data Analytics Dashboard:

Visualization of farm data to assist authorities in policy making and disease surveillance.

## How It Addresses the Problem

Empowers farmers with accurate, easy-to-understand biosecurity information.

Reduces disease outbreaks through proactive risk assessment and real-time alerts.

Supports authorities in creating data-driven health strategies.

Encourages digitization in the livestock sector, improving transparency and record management.

Bridges the gap between government policies and farmer-level implementation.


## Innovation and Uniqueness of the Solution

AI-powered risk assessment for individual farm conditions.

Mobile-first multilingual interface accessible even in low-internet rural areas.

Gamified learning modules for farmers to promote engagement.

Integration with GIS and IoT sensors for real-time data tracking in the advanced version.

Community collaboration model connecting multiple stakeholders.

This combination of education, monitoring, and policy integration in a single platform is unique in the Indian livestock ecosystem.

## Technical Approach
Technologies to be Used

Frontend: React.js / Flutter (for web and mobile compatibility)

Backend: Node.js / Django

Database: Firebase / MongoDB / PostgreSQL

AI & Analytics: Python (Machine Learning), TensorFlow, Pandas

Cloud Hosting: AWS / Google Cloud

APIs: Government disease surveillance APIs, GPS-based location services

Methodology and Process for Implementation

Step 1: Requirement Analysis

Identify biosecurity parameters and government standards.

Collect feedback from pig and poultry farmers.

Step 2: Design and Development

Create wireframes and UI/UX prototypes.

Develop web and mobile interfaces.

Step 3: Integration and Testing

Implement backend logic, database, and alert systems.

Conduct pilot testing on selected farms.

Step 4: Deployment and Feedback

Deploy on cloud servers.

Gather user feedback and continuously update the portal.

Flow (Simplified):
Farmer Login → Risk Assessment → Training → Record Management → Alerts → Compliance Report
